# Workflows

Once you've done everything the main README file under "Deployment" you should have moved the `.github/disabled-workflows/build.yml` into this directory.  The github site builder will not start the job if you do not at least do one manual push to the gh-pages branch.  Learn from my headache and follow the steps first.  Don't try to enable the build action as part of your first commit.
